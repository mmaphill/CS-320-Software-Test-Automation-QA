### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code has functionality and security I test and validate my code throughout the coding process. I create validation rules for objects, such as methods to make sure IDs are unique and not null. I can use JUnit tests to verify that classes are behaving as expected under various conditions. Running these tests can help to catch logical errors early and will confirm that invalid data was properly rejected. One method to keep things secure, I keep unique fields from being able to be altered. Another is to follow principles of encapsulation, which can prevent unauthorized modification of data. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpret users needs, I start with first trying to understand the problem that the software, or program, is solving. I do this by analyzing the requirements that are provided by the customer/stakeholders. After the problem has been realized, I translate the requirements into functional requirements and build the class(es) to reflect real-world use cases. Then testing is completed to ensure that the intended results happen and adjust as needed.

### How do I approach designing software?
My approach to softare design follows object-oritented methodology. I start by breaking down the system into modular components, such as creating separate classes to each handle their own respective responsibilities. Next, I design service classes to manage the creation, updating, and deletion of these objects. I also use unit testing to confirm that every module works independently before integrating them together. Combining these allows for me to create software that is scalable, maintainable, and aligned with user/customer needs.
